# AI Project - Minesweeper
This is a repository of my Python code for AI programming. I created it based on the Introduction to AI in Python course from Harvard Online. It contains my exercises and examples of AI applications in Python.

## Minesweeper
### Objective:
To build AI knowledge-base agent capable of playing Minesweeper game. This project focuses on Knowledge Engineering, which involves capturing, representing, and organizing knowledge in a way that can be effectively utilized by AI models. The goal of the knowledge engineering is to make explicit the knowledge that humans possess in a particular domain and enable AI systems to reason, learn, and make decisions based on the knowledge.
### Goal:
to flag (identify) each of the mines on the game board
